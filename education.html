          <li>I also participated actively in sports, particularly in running events. Sports day was always an exciting time for me, and I took part in several races, often finishing in the top positions. These events taught me the importance of discipline, perseverance, and physical fitness.</li>
          <li>In addition to my academic and sports achivements, I was pround to serve as a school prefect. This role helped me develop leadership skills and a sense of responsibility. I learned to manage my time efficiently, balancing my duties with my studies and extracurricular activities.</li>
